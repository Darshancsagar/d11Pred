India are entering the competition armed with a full-strength team for the first time in several months. They completed a camp in Alur on the outskirts of Bengaluru, and head coach Rahul Dravid expressed confidence in the lineup, with the likes of Shreyas Iyer and Jasprit Bumrah returning to the setup. But India will be hoping that their lack of game time doesn't turn out to be a factor as they'll hope to hit the straps straightaway. With the lack of adequate ODIs in the lead-up to the World Cup, the game-time for all the members would be as much in focus as the game itself.

Pakistan began their Asia Cup campaign on a confident note, riding on tons from Babar Azam and Iftikhar Ahmed, and a clinical bowling performance, to register a big win. Armed with fit and firing personnel, they've already made sure that their performances are taken note of in these conditions. There were some concerns, though. Fakhar Zaman had another failure at the top of the order, and the Pakistan batting department was kept in check by Nepal for the majority of the game before Babar and Iftikhar powered them to a sizable total. Shaheen Afridi wasn't in the best of rhythms despite picking up a couple of wickets, and he also needed some attention close to the boundary ropes, which Pakistan will be hoping doesn't turn out into something serious.

When: Saturday, September 2 at 3:00 PM Local Time

Where: Pallekele International Cricket Stadium

What to expect: Rain and thunderstorms, with a thick cloud cover throughout.

Team News & Tactics:

Pakistan: Despite his recent struggles, the hosts of the tournament have given Zaman another go, perhaps considering his record against India in the past, as they named an unchanged XI.

Afridi will be Pakistan's key weapon against the Indian top order, considering Rohit and Virat Kohli's numbers against left-arm pace since 2021. Rohit averages 25.8 against this variety and has been dismissed five times, while Kohli has fallen to left-arm pace thrice and averages 29. Kohli has also been dismissed seven times by a left-arm orthodox spinner and averages 14.57, while Ishan Kishan has been dismissed five times with an average of 29, which also makes Mohammad Nawaz an important option for Pakistan.

Playing XI: Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Agha Salman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf

India: The Rohit Sharma-led side will welcome back Shreyas, who along with Kishan, will man the middle order. It could be a toss-up between Shardul Thakur and Axar Patel if India is looking for an extra batting option, with the latter probably ahead given the slow nature of the Pallekele pitch.

Kuldeep Yadav has good numbers against Babar and Zaman, having dismissed them two times apiece, with the two batters averaging 9 and 14 against him, respectively.

Probable XI: Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Ishan Kishan (wk), Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur/Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj

#### Did you know?

- Since the 2019 World Cup, Ravindra Jadeja has scored 448 runs at an average of 49.77. But he has gone wicketless in 10 of the 22 innings he's bowled in this timeframe.
